Congratulations and welcome to Capish, you are now officially part of
our community. <br> <br>
<strong>Getting started as a Capisher:</strong><br>
     <strong>1.</strong> Create your account and review your profile. You'll see some pretty cool stuff about your Instagram account that you probably might not be aware of: <a style="color:#e74c3c;" href="http://capish.co">capish.co</a><br>
     <strong>2.</strong> We are all full of ideas. Pitch an idea to a brand and see what happens: <a style="color:#e74c3c;" href="http://capish.co/brands">capish.co/brands</a><br>
     <strong>3.</strong> Fill in your bio so brands can get to know you better: <a href="http://capish.co/login">Login Now!</a>
