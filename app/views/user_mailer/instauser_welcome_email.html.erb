Hello <%= @user.firstname %>!<br>

Congratulations and welcome to Capish, you are now officially part of our community. <br>
 <br> 

Getting started as a Capisher:  <br>

     1. Create your account and review your profile. You'll see some pretty cool stuff about your Instagram account that you probably aren't aware of: <a href="http://capish.co">capish.co</a><br>       
     2. We are all full of ideas. Pitch an idea to a brand and see what happens: <a href="http://capish.co/brands">capish.co/brands</a> <br>

     3. Fill in your bio so brands can get to know you better: <a href="http://capish.co/login">Login Now!</a>

P.S. Capish was created for YOU and as one of the first members of our community, you have the opportunity to help us build Capish into a community that you love (maybe even as much as Instagram!). We love feedback so feel free to email us at hi@capish.co. We'd love to hear from you.
