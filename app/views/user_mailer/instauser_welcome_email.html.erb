Hello <%= @user.firstname %>!<br>

Congratulations and welcome to Capish, you are now officially part of our community. <br>
 <br> 

Getting started as a Capisher:  <br>

     1. Log in to your account and review your profile. You'll see some pretty cool stuff about your Instagram account that you probably aren't aware of: <a href="http://capish.co">capish.co</a><br>       
     2. We are all full of ideas. So you can pitch your ideas to a brand: <a href="http://capish.co/brands">capish.co/brands</a> <br>

     3. Fill in your profile so brands can find and get to know you better. 
     <br><br>
If clicking the url doesn't take you to capish.co, you can copy and paste the link into your web browser's address bar.
<br>
Oh and make sure to add hi@capish.co to your email contacts to make sure our emails get to your inbox.  You'll be hearing from us again soon. <br>
<br>
Thank you, 
The Capish crew
<br>
P.S. Capish was created for YOU and as one of the first members of our community, you have the opportunity to really help us build Capish into a community that you love (maybe even as much as Instagram!). We love feedback so feel free to email us at hi@capish.co. We'd love to hear from you.
