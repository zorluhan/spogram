Privacy

Hi There!

You must be concerned about your privacy if you are reading this message. Your time is valuable so we’ll keep it simple.

We collect your email address and no other information from you.
We’ll use this information by adding you to our list of interested customers, send you occasional newsletters that include an opt-out link, and let you know when our service is ready to use.
We promise not to transfer your information to 3rd party services that are not directly required for us to perform business.
Every email we send will include a link to opt out of any future communication. You can also contact hi@capish.co directly if you wish for your data to be 100% deleted.
That’s all for now! This policy may be changed in the future, but we realize that you’re paying us with your attention and it’s our goal to respect that transaction.
