# 0.1.6

* (troessner) Revert 'Fixing set_initial_state with Mongoid' because of https://github.com/troessner/transitions/issues/76

* (simonc) Fixing set_initial_state with Mongoid

# 0.1.4

(troessner)

* Raise exception if we try to overwrite existing instance methods when defining state predicate methods
* Improve exception message if we try to overwrite existing class methods when ActiveRecord scopes

# 0.1.3

(troessner) Make sure `empty?` works on symbols.

# 0.1.2

(troessner) Slightly improved handling of current states.

# 0.1.1

* (troessner) Remove feature:
                `Do not override existing methods when defining state query methods but warn the user.`
              since this turned out to cause some problems when loading models, see
              https://github.com/troessner/transitions/issues/62 for details.
* (bnmrrs) Add helper methods to check if a given transition is possible.

# 0.1.0

(troessner) Remove suppport for multipe state machines

Here is the reasoning:

1.) If you really need multiple state machines for one model, you probably need multiple models.
    So far, I have not seen a valid use case for multiple state machines, which was not better expressed
    by using multiple models.

2.) The current transitions semantics and  API is not suited for multiple state machines:
    Right now events are just plain methods defined on the models itself.
    Consider you had multiple state machines, on named `day` and one named `night`, both with differing events.
    What to do when you switch to state machine `day` but trigger an event defined on `night`?
    You can either allow it, but this would make multiple state machines pointless if there is no enforced
    separation of concerns. Or you disallow it, in which case `events` would either have to be bound
    to state machines, not to the object itself, which would be tedious and ugly, or the `events` themselves
    would need to check if they are allowed to be called. The last solution seems like a clean solution
    but it would require a decent amount of rewriting existing code - and I just do not see the benefit for this.

3.) Kind of a weak point, but right now the functionality is broken anyway throughout the gem. This functionality
    is not even documented, so the side effects on existing projects should be minimal.

On the plus side, removing the possibility of having multiple state machines will streamline and improve existing
code a lot.
